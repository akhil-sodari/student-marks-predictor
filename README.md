This project aims to solve the business problem faced by the Residential Schools or Colleges, in order to schedule 
the timings of study hours for students so as to score the % they wished for.

## Description
This project uses Linear Regression algorithm since we have just 2 features and the relationship between them is Linear(look at the plot below) and as this was my 
first ML project I just want to keep it simple :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

I used Jupyter Notebook for developing this project, alternatively you can also use Google Colab if you want to work on cloud. And I used Flask micro web framework, as the backend,
to get a working product on to my localhost.


## Installation
You can install Anaconda to get all the required modules for this project or install the below modules on to you host using pip. Finally we will be using a Code Editor for writing
code in Flask, I suggest you to use either Spyder or PyCharm.

* NumPy
```bash
pip install numpy
```
* Pandas
```bash
pip install pandas
```
* sklearn
```bash
pip install sklearn
```
* flask
```bash
pip install flask
```
## Clone the project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/akhil-sodari/student-marks-predictor.git
```
